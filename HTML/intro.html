    <h1>Intro HTML</h1>
    <p>In the quiet of the morning light,<br>
        Before the world begins its day,<br>
        I find my home within your sight,<br>
        In every word you never say. <br>
        It’s not a fire that burns and dies, <br>
        Nor like a storm that shakes the shore;<br>
        It’s in the way you meet my eyes<br>
        And make me feel I’m something more.<br>
        Through tangled paths and shifting tides,<br>
        Where shadows grow and colors fade,<br>
        The heart is where your ghost resides,<br>
        A steady light within the shade.<br>
        For love is not a single act,<br>
        But a thousand threads that time has spun—<br>
        A quiet, unwritten, holy pact<br>
        That two separate lives have become one.
    </p>
